# Open TODOs

## 20211209
* fail: subdir `tempgifs` has to be created manually, else the PiCamGifForTumblr.sh fails while taking the photos -> create manually or with the bash itself
* question: what is the current file-limit for upload to tumblr? size and amount of posts per day?
* fail: mogrify not found -> install? create hint in the README as preparation?
