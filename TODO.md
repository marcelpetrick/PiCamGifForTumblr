# Open TODOs

## 20211209
* fail: subdir `tempgifs` has to be created manually, else the PiCamGifForTumblr.sh fails while taking the photos -> create manually or with the bash itself
* question: what is the current file-limit for upload to tumblr? size and amount of posts per day?
* fail: mogrify not found -> install? create hint in the README as preparation?
  * `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`
* fail `./PiCamGifForTumblr.sh: line 63: gifsicle: command not found`
  * `sudo apt-get install gifsicle`
* fail: pytumble.py?!? file exists maybe on the old catcam, but is missing in repo; also document how to configure the API-key :/
