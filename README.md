# PiCamGifForTumblr

Smol script to create some 'webcam-tumblr'.  
Takes 30 photos of reduced size (500px in width), then tries to create a GIF with as much as possible frames while still obeying the size-limit of 3 MiByte.  
If the file would be bigger, the tumblr stops the animation and shows just a still, which is .. bad.  

See my blog http://marcelpetrick.bplaced.net/wp_solutionsnotcode/ on how to set up the other needed stuff on your Raspberry Pi :)
